<h2 id="genonprojectnotes">GenOn Project Notes</h2>

<p>In order to meet timeline goals, generation On will be devleoped jointly by POL Digital and Fission Strategy. We need Fission to implement the GenerationOn website from its design in PDFs into a content management system. This will primarily be front-end work and content managment system work. We estimate that with the combined resources, we can target a release date of August 7th &#8211; about 10.5 weeks. </p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>When taking a look at this website, note that much of the is application-driven. If we divvy the application up into &#8220;Content&#8221; vs &#8220;Application,&#8221; and try and look at the wireframes through that lens:</p>

<ol>
<li>Homepage &#8211; Aggregated Content + Application</li>
<li>Dashboard &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Track Your Service &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Fact Sheet/Resource Page &#8211; Content (with login component)</li>
<li>Resource List &#8211; Content (aggregated)</li>
<li>Projects and Causes &#8211; Content (aggregated)</li>
<li>Project PAge &#8211; Content (aggregated)</li>
<li>Past Service Tracker Report - Application</li>
<li>Login - Application</li>
<li>JoinPages &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Grants &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Donate &#8211; Content (needs revision)</li>
<li>Day of Service &#8211; Archive (Content)</li>
<li>Story &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Campaigns &#8211; Application</li>
<li>Article &#8211; Content</li>
<li>Calendar &#8211; Calendar</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see we&#8217;ve got a lot of application mixed up in our content. For that reason we are taking an API driven approach. October will be hosting the content as well as view templates for the application, with application based content being served through javascript on October pages. This will allow for page templates to be edited by non-technical staff, while at the same time keeping application and content code mostly separated. </p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hiding static content behind a login. Necessary?</li>
<li>There are some missing creatives. For instance, story collection. Does that come from the service tracker entirely? Some of these appear in the wireframes.</li>
<li>How will auth work against changemaker?</li>
